For each topic, students have the choice of a few different projects, each with a different method/data set. Generally, the options are: numerical modeling, tank modeling, ocean data, and atmospheric data. On the first day of each unit the instructors introduce the projects and students divide into groups. Most sessions, the students work in groups during classtime with help from the instructors.
